message sending and receiving is working
## UOTD (*update of the day*)
  I've been working on a more appealing gui written in html. So far the basic backend is written in python using flask, unfortunately there are still a number of features that have not been added. 
  
  Here's the status on the features:
	

    ALWAYS ENCRYPT - Available in the TK gui | Under dev in new gui
    LOAD KEY - Available in the TK gui | Not in new gui
    SEND ENCRYPTION KEY - Available in the TK gui | Not in new gui
    SEND MESSAGE - Available in both
    RECEIVE MESSAGE - Available in both
    CREAT ACCOUNT - Available in both
    LOG IN - Available in both
    KEY TRANSFER - Available in TK | not yet in the new gui
    TOKEN TRANSFER - Available in only the gui (will not be in the TK)
    ISOLATED KEy TRANSFER - Going public soon!

Work will be continuing through-out the next few days - Apr 27th
